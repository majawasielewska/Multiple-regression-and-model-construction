The aim of the project was to build all combinations of linear models for all possible combinations of independent variables in order to extract the best model (which variables have the greatest impact on the number of days the student performs strenuous physical exercise).

Before building the model, the data set was analyzed and prepared.

The data (physical_activity_data.xlsx) structure contains 248 objects (high school students enrolled in physical education courses) and 5 variables, such as NUMBER OF DAYS, PERSONAL GOAL, SOCIAL SUPPORT, BARRIERS, EXPECTATIONS (LICZBA DNI, OSOBISTY CEL, WSPARCIE SPOŁECZNE, BARIERY, OCZEKIWANIA). The dependent variable is NUMBER OF DAYS (LICZBA DNI). 

Results: 
Measures defined in the cognitive-social theory are correlated with physical exercise "in leisure time". High school students' strenuous exercise is influenced by their personal goal, community support, personal ability to overcome barriers to exercise, and performance expectations. The best model turned out to be the model with the variables PERSONAL GOAL and EXPECTATIONS. These are the factors that have the greatest impact on the number of days a student engages in strenuous physical activity. However, it should be taken into account that these students may have provided false information.

Estimated regression equation for the best model:
DAYS = -0.5336 + 0.0348 * PERSONAL GOAL + 0.0364 * EXPECTATIONS + ϵ

For the purpose of the project, variables and comments were written in Polish.

The dataset based on research by Winters et al. (A-15). (www.wiley.com/college/daniel)

Description of the set:
They concern the participation of 248 high school students enrolled in introductory physical education courses. he researchers wanted to know if social cognitive theory constructs were correlated with discretionary, “leisure-time” physical exercise.
